# Pokemon app - Made with Next.js (Small POC)

This project presents a list of pokemon.
By clicking on each Pokemon’s name, the page would redirect to a detailed page, showing the pokemon’s description like type, stats, and image.

<u>*P.S*:</u>
I want to say thanks to the person who provides the link I’m using to fetch all the Pokemon data.
